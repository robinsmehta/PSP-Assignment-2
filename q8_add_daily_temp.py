'''Write a function called add_daily_temp that is given a (possibly empty) dictionary meant to hold the average daily temperature for each day of the week, a temperature value, and the day of the week for the recorded temperature. The function should then add the temperature to the dictionary only if it does not already contain a temperature for that day. The function should return the resulting dictionary, whether it is updated or not.'''
